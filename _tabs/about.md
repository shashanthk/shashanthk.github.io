Hi, my name is Shashanth and I am a software engineer based in Mangaluru (Mangalore) with over seven years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and related technologies. 

This blog documents what I’ve learned by referring to online resources and serves as my way of giving back in gratitude. While much of the content is generated using ChatGPT and other AI tools, it’s grounded in my own hands‑on experience. I draw on past projects and lessons learned to provide practical, real‑world insights. My goal is to help anyone who visits this site benefit from the knowledge I’ve gained.
